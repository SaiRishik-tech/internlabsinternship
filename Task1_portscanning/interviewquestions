What is an open port?
An open port is a network port that accepts incoming connections, allowing services like web servers or SSH to communicate.
Example: Port 80 open means a web server is accessible.

How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
Nmap sends a SYN packet; if it gets SYN-ACK, the port is open, then it resets the connection to avoid full handshake.
Example: Detects open ports stealthily on a Linux server.

What risks are associated with open ports?
Open ports expose services that could be vulnerable to exploits, brute-force attacks, or data leaks.
Example: An open Telnet port (23) can be exploited for remote access.

Difference between TCP and UDP scanning?
TCP scans rely on connection responses; UDP scans are slower and detect services without handshakes.
Example: TCP 80 for HTTP vs. UDP 53 for DNS.

How can open ports be secured?
Disable unused ports, use firewalls, apply service restrictions, and enable encryption or authentication.
Example: Close port 21 (FTP) if not used; switch to SFTP.

What is a firewall's role regarding ports?
Firewalls block or allow traffic based on port rules, controlling access to network services.
Example: Blocking port 3389 (RDP) from public internet.

What is a port scan and why do attackers perform it?
A port scan maps open ports to find potential entry points for exploitation.
Example: Scanning a companyâ€™s server to detect open SSH for brute-force.

How does Wireshark complement port scanning?
Wireshark captures and analyzes packet-level responses to port scans, helping validate scan results or detect suspicious scans.
Example: Verifying Nmap SYN scans with packet traces.
