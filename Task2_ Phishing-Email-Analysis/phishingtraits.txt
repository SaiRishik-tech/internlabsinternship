Phishing Indicator	     Details from Screenshot
Sender Email	             TrackingUpdates@emails-track.com → suspicious, not an official FedEx domain
Generic Greeting	     "Hi, Demo" → no personalization, looks like a mass message
Urgency/Threat Language     “If we do not receive a response, the package will be returned to sender” → creates fear
Suspicious Link	            "MANAGE DELIVERY" link likely redirects to malicious site (hover to check in real email)
Brand Abuse	             Logo used to appear trustworthy, even though it's from an unverified sender
Tracking Number  	     Fake number to increase trust, not verifiable without login
